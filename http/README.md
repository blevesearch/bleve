# http support in bleve

This http package is purely for the demonstration purposes and is used by sample
applications like https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve-explorer.

Please be aware that the http handler implementations neither provide exhaustive
user input validations nor authentication or authorization of the user access.

So, it is strongly recommended that users exercise caution while using the http
package in production situations.

[Here](https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/security/advisories/GHSA-9w9f-6mg8-jp7w) is the security advisory on this.
