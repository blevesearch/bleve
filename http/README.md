# http support in bleve

This http package is purely for the demonstration purposes and is used by sample
applications like https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve-explorer.

Please be aware that the http handler implementations neither provide exhaustive 
user input validations nor authentication or authorization of the user access. 

So, it is recommended to remain cautious against the use of the http package in 
production use cases.
