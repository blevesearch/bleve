{"name":"Hooker Oktoberfest","abv":5.8,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"thomas_hooker_brewing","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Originally brewed to celebrate the beginning of the German brewing season and the 1810 wedding of crown prince Ludwig of Bavaria and his bride-to-be, princess Therese of Saxon-Hildburghausen. This amber beer was brewed in March (\"Marzenbier\") and left to age in cool lagering caves during the heat of the summer. Our rich and satisfying Bavarian-style OctoberFest comes from a special blend of imported German malts that creates a full-bodied brew and stresses a malty flavor and lingering aroma. Gently hopped and delicately balanced, its true-to-style, slow fermentation and long, cold maturation produces a luxuriously smooth, award-winning brew.","style":"German-Style Oktoberfest","category":"German Lager"}
