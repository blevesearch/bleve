The taste perceived in the mouth is a balance confirming the fruity nuances noticed in the fragrance. \r\n\r\nIts taste, which imparts a silky sensation to the tongue, is made refreshing by a light touch of bitterness. To the palate, the taster perceives a pleasant astringency which complements the flavour qualities of this beer very harmoniously.\r\n\r\nThis top fermented Trappist beer, refermented in the bottle, is not pasteurised.","style":"Belgian-Style Dubbel","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
