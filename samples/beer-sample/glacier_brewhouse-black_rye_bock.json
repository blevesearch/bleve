{"name":"Black Rye Bock","abv":6.2,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"glacier_brewhouse","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"This dark lager combines the characteristics of three winter beer styles. All three of these styles traditionally come from the colder harsher areas of Europe. The styles are (1) Black Beer (aka schwartzbier) originating from the former East Germany); (2) Rye Beer which at one time was only made in hardier areas of Eastern and Baltic Europe; and (3) Bock Beer which is widely known as a higher alcohol lager of Northern Germany. Our Black Rye Bock has a distinctive bitter chocolate palate and black color reminiscent of a black beer. The spiciness from the rye malt shines through in the flavor. The high alcohol balanced with malty sweetness rounds out this cold season bock. Smooth drinking with a punch makes this lager a perfect quaffer for our Arctic winter. 6.2% alcohol by volume.","style":"Traditional German-Style Bock","category":"German Lager"}
