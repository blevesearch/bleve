In its first year, the brewery produced 1,500 barrels of beer. We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100 seat brew pub) and were forced to move up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand. Today, we brew over 62,000 barrels of beer and 3,000 barrels of root beer, and we're still growing! But don't let our growth fool you. Our lagers and ales are still brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews. Abita uses only the finest ingredients  British and American barley, German yeast, European and Washington State hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs. In Abita, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way. Abita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes. We're proud of our brewery and the beers we make. Try Abita Beer today and taste a bit of the South!","address":["PO Box 1510"],"geo":{"accuracy":"APPROXIMATE","lat":30.5049,"lon":-89.944}}
