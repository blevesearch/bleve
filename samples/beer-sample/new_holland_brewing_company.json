{"name":"New Holland Brewing Company","city":"Holland","state":"Michigan","code":"49423","country":"United States","phone":"1-616-355-6422","website":"http://newhollandbrew.com","type":"brewery","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Established in 1996, NHBC has grown from a scrappy two-man start-up to a thriving regional microbrewery, recognized for its creativity and artistry. We are very proud of our accomplishments thus far, and believe in earning our place in the brewing industry and in our customer's hearts and minds everyday. All of our beer is brewed in Holland, Michigan at one of our two locations. We brew, cellar and package the main brands for distribution at our production facility on the north-side of Holland, at 690 Commerce Court. In response to our considerable growth, we opened the new brewery in October of 2006, replacing the original headquarters.  We also brew beer and distill spirits in our pub. The pub is a great place for us to explore new ideas, meet our customers in a comfortable setting and provide a place of community for all who visit. The beers made here are typically special brews that rarely see their way outside of the friendly confines of our pub. In 2007, we brewed and shipped just over 7,400 barrels of beer. (A barrel = 31 gallons.) We work hard to bring you an authentic, interesting and gratifying experience.","address":["66 East Eighth Street"],"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":42.79,"lon":-86.1041}}
