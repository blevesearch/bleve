Built out of a dream and a passion for home brewing, what started out as a hobby quickly became a thriving business.  As the years have passed, Founders has built its brewery on the exploration of recipe development and brewing techniques. We are not the standard micro-brewery, rather we have traveled a path that breaks from the standard craft-brewer. Carving a niche out of the craft industry, Founders Brewing Company has built its reputation on producing very unique beers. Our focus is to offer our wholesalers, retailers and consumers a product that stands alone on the shelf and offers a true drinking experience to our friends, the consumer.
