The perfect beer to accompany a meal or for a summer's day. The wheat contributes a lighter flavor while maintaining a rich body. The beer has a light hop profile -- just enough to give the beer balance and complexity. The light fruitiness is derived from a Kölsch yeast strain. A chill haze may be present, which is a characteristic of wheat beers. \r\n\r\nSaint Arnold Texas Wheat is best consumed at 40-45° Fahrenheit."}
