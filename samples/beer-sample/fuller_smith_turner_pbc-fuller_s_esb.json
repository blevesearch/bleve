The potential of the beer was soon realised and ESB was installed as a permanent fixture, creating an immediate impact. \r\n\r\nNot only was it one of the strongest regularly brewed draught beers in the country (at 5.5% ABV), it was also one of the tastiest, and as the awareness of the beer grew, so did its popularity. ESB's reputation was soon enhanced after being named CAMRA's (Campaign for Real Ale) Beer of the Year in 1978, and the beer has not stopped winning since! \r\n\r\nWith three CAMRA Beer of the Year awards, two World Champion Beer awards, and numerous other gold medals to speak of, ESB is, quite simply, the Champion Ale.","style":"Extra Special Bitter","category":"British Ale"}
