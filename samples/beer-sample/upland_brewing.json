The Tap Room and Biergarten has six everyday Upland beers on tap with additional Seasonal brews (Oktoberfest, Winter Warmer, Chocolate Stout, Maibock�yea springtime!) throughout the year. (Check the News section opposite for seasonal release dates and related celebrations.) The Tap Room restaurant offers an eclectic menu of great pub grub (signature nachos, rib tips like no others) plus dinner fare that addresses sophisticated palates with cuisines from around the world. (Yes, we're a brew pub, but our wine list is excellent). Better yet, sign on to our Upland Update to learn who's performing. And while you're here be sure to check out the weekly dinner specials from the fertile imaginations of our excellent restaurant crew. Part of a group that's interested in brewing? Arrange for a brewery tour. We are proud of our hand-crafted, award-winning beers and would be delighted to guide you through the many stages involved in the brewing process. In the meantime, take the Virtual Tour for an inside look at how glorious stainless steel can be when directed to perform a noble task! Most of all, everyone here welcomes you to come by and partake of the Upland Experience�where great food, great beer, and great friends come together. Can't get to Bloomington? No problemo. As Indiana's largest microbrewer, you can find Upland beers in better stores, taverns, and restaurants throughout the state of Indiana.","address":["350 West Eleventh Street"],"geo":{"accuracy":"RANGE_INTERPOLATED","lat":39.1733,"lon":-86.5369}}
