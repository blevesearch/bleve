Brewed with Pale, Carahell and Wheat malts, Amarillo and Cascade hops. This medium bodied beer is crisp on the palate with a smooth, not overly bitter hops flavor coupled with the fruity esters from the Belgian Abby yeast strain we used. Its bottle and keg conditioned, so expect a tall, fluffy head, and perhaps small amount of sediment. Just one batch was brewed in April 2008, kegs released in late May, and only 20 cases of bottles for sale only at the brewery at the special debut night event of June 13, 2008, from 5 to 8 pm. Recipe by Jeff Musselman, assistant brewer.","style":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","category":"Belgian and French Ale"}
