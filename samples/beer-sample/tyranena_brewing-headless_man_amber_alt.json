Unfortunately, most of these structures have fallen victim to the farmer's plow over the past 150 years.  Not far from the brewery, lying preserved on the floor of Rock Lake, are two effigy mounds - a Headless Man and a Turtle.  Legend tells us, as the Turtle can survive on both land and in water, its spirit helped guide the Headless Man into the afterlife.  May the Turtle's spirit guide you to happiness with a Headless Man Amber Alt.\r\n\r\nThe Headless Man is brewed in the \"old way\" of a Düsseldorf-style Altbier.  A unique cold lagering process gives this amber ale its smooth taste.","style":"German-Style Brown Ale/Altbier","category":"German Ale"}
