A long tradition that all the German brewers still obey to: In 1165 the first fine for serving bad beer was imposed in Augsburg. From 1487 onwards every brewer in Munich had to confirm on an oath to the ducal Rentmeister of Upper Bavaria, stating that he would not use any ingredients but barley, hops, and water to brew beer. Originally, this oath was valid in Munich only. In 1987 it was renewed by the Munich brewers.","address":["491 Ontario Street"],"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":42.9561,"lon":-78.8966}}
