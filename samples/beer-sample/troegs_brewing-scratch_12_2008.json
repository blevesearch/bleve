In these chaotic days of shrinking hop harvests, balance is key to a proper IPA. Scratch #12-2008 delivers an intense pine nose married with a subtle wildflower aroma. The Thames Valley yeast adds an earthy nod to traditional English IPAs, while the American hops provide a bold contrasting bitterness.\r\n \r\nBreath deep, relax, enjoy.","style":"American-Style India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
