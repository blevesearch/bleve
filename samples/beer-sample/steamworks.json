The Gastown Brewing Company, which is located onsite and brews Steamworks beers, uses steam to fire its kettles. The instant heat of steam allows for greater brewing finesse, and most importantly great tasting beer. Whether you're in the mood for a thirst quenching Lions Gate lager, or a full bodied HeriocaTM Oatmeal Stout, we've got a beer to please your palate.","address":["375 Water Street"],"geo":{"accuracy":"ROOFTOP","lat":49.2849,"lon":-123.11}}
