This beer took years of practice to get down and when we finally got it right, we knew it. The beer is made with three malts in considerable additions that leave it with a more malty and sweet taste. There are five different hop additions that were carefully planed out to impart just enough bitterness to give it the body and depth that it needed without leaving you with the astringent and bitter aftertaste. We then added a plethora of English flavor and aroma hops that round out the floral and citrus esters. With the beer being so well balanced between bitter and sweet, we than added \"big sacks\" of bittering hops to the conditioning vessel to impart all the wonderful citrus and floral notes deep into the beer while leaving the bittering aspects of the hop behind. The result was a beer that makes you want to nose dive right in complimented by the well balanced taste of this wonderful brew.","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
