{"name":"Hop Juice Double IPA","abv":9.4,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"left_coast_brewing","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"Here at Left Coast Brewing Co. we pride ourselves on being one of the first breweries to pioneer a Double IPA style beer. In 2003, we brewed our first Double IPA, and haven't looked back since. This hop monster uses Premium American 2- Row and a touch of light crystal malt to create a solid malt foundation. The recipe calls for hops to be used in every step of the brewing process; in the mash, in a hop back, in the fermenter, and in the bright tanks. We use hop extract, hop pellets and hop flowers, hence the name Hop Juice. Hop Juice spends more than 4 weeks dry hopping in the fermenter and the bright beer tank. It is approximately 9.4% abv and has massive IBUs. Hop usage is over 4lbs per barrel. Hopeheads, step up to the plate!","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
