Pabst was originally called \"Select,\" but people started asking for that \"Blue Ribbon\" beer in 1882 when we started tying silk ribbons to the bottles. We officially added the words \"Blue Ribbon\" to the bottle in 1895.\r\n\r\nPabst was the first brewery to put beer in cans back in 1935. This was Blue Ribbon beer but it was called \"Export\" when sold in the can. Our first cans had a picture of a can opener on the side with instructions on how to open the can of beer, with the can opener.\r\n\r\nToday, this classic American brew has been adopted by a whole new generation of PBR drinkers. Currently, PBR is one of the fastest growing domestic beer brands.
