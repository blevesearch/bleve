At only 3.7% alcohol, Adnams Bitter is the classic English 'ordinary,' though we think you'll agree that there's full of flavor.\r\n\r\nDespite its rich heritage and enduring fame, Adnams is not a company willing to rest on its laurels. Its continued commitment to quality and innovative packaging designs has made it Britain’s fastest growing brewery over the last two years. To top it off, Adnams’ head brewer was recently chosen as Britain’s Brewer of the Year by a panel of his peers.","style":"Extra Special Bitter","category":"British Ale"}
