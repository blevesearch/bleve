If you're no longer scared of the dark, then there's no reason to be afraid of our stout. A generous portion of rolled oats and lots of black roasted barley give this beer a warm, roasted nose, and a distinct dryness that succumbs to waves of lingering satisfaction.","style":"Oatmeal Stout","category":"British Ale"}
