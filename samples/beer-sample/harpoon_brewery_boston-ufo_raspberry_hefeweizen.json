{"name":"UFO Raspberry Hefeweizen","abv":4.8,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"harpoon_brewery_boston","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"We have added natural raspberry flavor to our UFO Hefeweizen to create this beer.  Consistent with the hefeweizen style, this beer is unfiltered and cloudy with a solid foamy head.  UFO Raspberry has a distinctive, hazy rose color.  The scent of fresh raspberries hits the nose immediately, along with a subtle bready aroma from the wheat and yeast.  The body is light and the unfiltered yeast provides a soft mouthfeel.  The taste of the fruit compliments the beer nicely, neither overwhelms the other.  There is a faint sweetness on the palate, which finishes cleanly in a semi-dry, tart finish.","style":"Fruit Beer","category":"Other Style"}
