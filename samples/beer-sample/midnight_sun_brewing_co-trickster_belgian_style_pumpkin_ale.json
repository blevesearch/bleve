{"name":"Trickster Belgian-style Pumpkin Ale","abv":7.0,"ibu":0.0,"srm":0.0,"upc":0,"type":"beer","brewery_id":"midnight_sun_brewing_co","updated":"2010-07-22 20:00:20","description":"OK, what do you get when we toss pale malted barley, pumpkin and spices into a stainless steel cauldron then stir in some magic? Uh, Trickster! The “magic” is actually mischievous Belgian yeast at play with cardamom, nutmeg and coriander. This spooky cool brew will make your glass glow bright despite the gloominess of the season. \r\n\r\nDesigned to conjure up a little fun during the darkening days of autumn, Trickster is a frivolous concoction of earthy pumpkin, comforting malt, and lively spices. This makes Trickster the brew to accompany your post-winterizing duties, family fall dinners, ghost stories, U-boast-iT stories, and “supposedly haunted” garage parties. \r\n\r\nBut the flavor range of Trickster also pairs well with citrusy and spicy cuisine. Try a glowing glass with your favorite dishes that incorporate nutmeg, cardamom or coriander—like Thai curries, Swedish meatballs, gingerbread, roasted pumpkin soup. Add Trickster to soups and sauces, batters and doughs, glasses and mugs.","style":"Pumpkin Beer","category":"Other Style"}
