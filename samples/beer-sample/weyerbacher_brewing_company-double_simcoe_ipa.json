Brewed  with Simcoe hops, developed and trademarked by Select Botanicals Group, LLC, in the year 2000. This hybrid hops was created to allow maximum aromatic oils, along with low cohumulone(harshness) levels, so that brewers can really load up a lot of 'em in a beer and not have any harshness. The piney, citrusy notes are all here, and in a very clean (non-harsh) way, as well as having an aroma with impact. Introduced by Weyerbacher in 2005 originally as a seasonal, this brew has garnered numbers so high on Beer Advocate, and been in such high demand by consumers,  we decided to add it to our year-round line-up in March 2007. Check it out, and you'll soon see why everyone's talking about it.","style":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","category":"North American Ale"}
